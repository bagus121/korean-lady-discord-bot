# Movie Night

We host movie nights on Saturdays at 8PM CET (Central European Time) and everyone is welcome to join!

We currently watch through **Discord** so grab some popcorn and join us in #movie-livechat for memes and live reactions!

> **Tip:** If you want to get a ping notification for movie nights, you can check the #roles channel and follow instructions there to get the @movies role.

## Voting

Every week a poll is added and pinned in the #movie-night channel so that anyone can vote or suggest movies to watch.

When suggesting a movie, keep in mind the person streaming it needs to have legal access to it (streaming services, DVD, Blu-Ray...) and a connection good enough to stream it. If you don't have a movie you can still suggest it or ask about it on Discord!

PS: You can vote your own movie suggestions.

## How to Join

When movie night starts, just join the Movie Night voice channel. You'll see a red "LIVE" badge next to the user streaming the movie.

You just need to mouse over that user and click the button to join their stream.

## Optional Tips

### How to Mute Discord Sounds

You can disable Discord sounds (pings, people leaving and joining voice chat, etc.) by turning on **Streamer Mode** while whatching movies. This will mute every sound in Discord except for voice chat and stream audio.

> **Tip:** You can toggle Streamer Mode on/off from Discord settings, but you can also assign a keybind to make it easier. Just go to `User Settings` > `Keybinds` and choose a combination of keys you never use in other programs, like `Control` + `F12` or something similar.

### Movie & Chat in One Screen

If you need to watch and chat in one single screen, and don't want to have to chat on your phone, here's a tip to keep both visible while optimizing space.

1. Pop the stream out so it's on its own window.
2. Move the main Discord window to the right side of the screen and resize it to be as narrow as possible. Disable the member list if you want.
3. Enable `Always on Top` from the bottom right corner of the stream window.
4. Resize the stream window to use all the space possible without obstructing chat.

It should look like the image below, and allow you to click on chat and type without the movie loosing focus.

## Troubleshooting

### No Audio

1. Make sure you have the correct audio device set in `User Settings` > `Voice & Video` > `Output Device`.
2. Make sure the volume in the stream window isn't set too low (sometimes it resets itself to 50%).
3. For some people, using the [web version of Discord](https://discord.com/) sometimes helps fix audio issues.

### No Video or Stream Laggy Only for You

1. Disconnect from the voice channel and connect again.
2. Restart Discord.

## Other Known Issues

These are the known issues with Discord screen sharing:

- Sometimes audio glitches for a few seconds during the stream causing robotic voices or similar. When this happens, it will fix on its own after a moment, usually about 30 seconds.
- Image quality comes and goes sometimes, making the video pixelated for a while. This seems unrelated to chosen stream settings (resolution, framerate...) or the streamer's connection, and more likely related to Discord server capacity at any given time, as well as the amount of movement on screen.
