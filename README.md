## Requirements

KoreanLady requires NodeJS, [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/) & [Enmap](https://enmap.evie.dev/).

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) & [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) are optional but recommended for easier setup and development.

You will also need to [create a Discord bot application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) so that your bot can connect to Discord, more instructions can be found below.


## Download

**[You can download the source code for KoreanLady from this link](https://github.com/yogensia/korean-lady-discord-bot/archive/master.zip)**.


## Running

The source is in the `src` directory.

1. First of all you'll need to [create a Discord bot application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).

2. Find the token for your application, should be found in the Bot section.

3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add the token for your discord bot in this file. Remember to keep this token private!

4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

5. Run the source with `npm run start` or `npm run dev`. The second option requires [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) and is used to monitor changes and reload the script as needed.

6. Go to the OAuth2 section in your bot application page. Enable the bot scope and select the permissions you need. This will create a link for you with your application's `client_id` and permissions. Copy and open that link, and follow instructions on the newly opened page to add your Bot to a server you have admin access to.

7. You should now find your bot online in your server, responding to your commands.
