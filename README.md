**KoreanLady** is a Discord bot coded in NodeJS using the [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.

It's meant to be a simple bot with a few fun commands and no moderation or any other advanced functions.

## Command List

You can find the [full list of available commands here](https://github.com/yogensia/korean-lady-discord-bot/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#koreanlady-discord-bot).

## Building requirements

KoreanLady requires NodeJS, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/) & [Enmap](https://enmap.evie.dev/).

[Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) is optional but recommended for easier setup and development.

You will also need to [create a Discord bot application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) so that your bot can connect to Discord, more instructions can be found below.

## Building & creating your own bot

This bot is open source so that anyone can download it, modify it and run it.

### Outline

You can find the source code in the `src` directory.

- `index.js` Initializes the bot and loads events/commands, which are found in their own subfolders.
- `src/events/messages.js` handles the message event and runs the according command if applicable.
- `src/utils/` contains some utility functions to make some repetitive tasks a bit easier and cleaner. This includes a basic [Twitch API (helix)](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api) request function.
- `/scripts/` is meant for additional utilities, like building the command list documentation.
- Each command has a simple set of properties: `name`, `description`, `usage`, `aliases`, etc. that are used by the bot to show help or detailed error messages when necessary aw well as define required arguments.
- Most of the commands are generic enough, but you decide to create your own fork of this bot, you may want to check the commands one by one and replace a few things, like emotes etc.

If you are new to making bots you can check [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/) and/or [anidiots.guide](https://anidiots.guide/) for lots of documentation and resources.

### Getting Started

To get started using this repo follow these steps:

1. First of all you'll need to [create a Discord bot application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).

2. Go to the OAuth2 section in your bot application page. Enable the bot scope and select the permissions you need. This will create a link for you with your application's `client_id` and permissions. Copy and open that link, and follow instructions on the newly opened page to add your Bot to a server you have admin access to.

3. Find the token for your application, should be found in the Bot section.

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add the token for your discord bot in this file. Remember to keep this token private!

5. Run `npm install` on the directory with the projects files if you haven't already to install dependencies.

6. Run the source with `npm run start` or `npm run dev`. The second option requires [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) and is used to monitor changes and reload the script as needed.

7. You should now find your bot online in your server, responding to your commands.
